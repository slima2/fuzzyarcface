Recognition systems must cope with formidable challenges including extreme pose variations, occlusions, 
noise, and nuanced facial expressions. Existing fixed-margin loss functions (e.g., ArcFace)
and certain dynamic-margin approaches (e.g., AdaptiveFace) often exhibit performance limitations
under such conditions. To address these gaps, we propose FuzzyArcLoss, a novel loss function
that leverages a fuzzy membership mechanism to dynamically adjust angular margins for enhanced
adaptability and robust performance.

Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (CPLFW, CALFW, JAFFE, CFP) confirm that
FuzzyArcLoss consistently outperforms both fixed-margin and existing dynamic-margin methods
(e.g., AdaptiveFace, VPL, SphereFace2, UniFace). In CPLFW and CALFW, FuzzyArcLoss achieves
top-tier F1 Scores (up to 0.90303 and 0.9079, respectively) along with elevated recall, balancing
precision and recall more effectively than competing algorithms. On CFP, characterized by pro-
nounced frontal-profile differences, FuzzyArcLoss (τ = 0.9) demonstrates consistently higher recall
under severe occlusions and compression artifacts compared to other loss functions.

Though Uniface attains the highest F1 Score on JAFFE (0.8528), FuzzyArcLoss leads in recall
(0.9475), underscoring its capacity to detect challenging cases involving extreme expressions, albeit
with a slight trade-off in precision. Across all datasets and augmentations—ranging from heavy
compression to extensive occlusions—FuzzyArcLoss exhibits remarkable robustness, highlighting the
importance of sample-level margin adjustments for addressing complex intra-class variability and
ambiguous scenarios. Consequently, FuzzyArcLoss emerges as a robust and highly adaptable solution
for face recognition and related recognition tasks, paving the way for improved handling of real-world
conditions where static or purely class-based margins fall short.
