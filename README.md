Face recognition systems have significantly benefited from introducing the
ArcFace loss function, which enhances the discrimination capability by focus-
ing on angular relationships within facial feature vectors. However, ArcFace
struggles with images positioned at or near class boundaries, such as those
affected by occlusions, lighting, or complex facial expressions. This paper
presents Fuzzy ArcFace, an enhanced loss function that integrates a fuzzy
membership function into the traditional ArcFace framework. The fuzzy
membership function dynamically adjusts the angular margin based on the
certainty of class membership. This adjustment provides a flexible and nu-
anced mechanism for classifying boundary cases more effectively. Extensive
experiments on the labeled faces in the wild (LFW), Japanese female facial
expression (JEFF), and celebrities in frontal-profile (CFP) datasets demon-
strate that Fuzzy ArcFace consistently outperforms ArcFace, especially in
challenging scenarios. Notably, Fuzzy ArcFace achieves the highest accuracy
on JEFF and CFP datasets by allowing more fluctuation in margin to accom-
modate nuanced images. These results highlight Fuzzy ArcFaceâ€™s potential
to enhance face recognition accuracy and robustness across diverse scenarios,
making it a promising tool for applications requiring high precision in face
verification
