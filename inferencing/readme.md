This is the repository for the script that
a. Generates obfuscated images from CFP and JEFF databases
b. Generates vector representations of obfuscated images using pretraining pth files
that varies according to tau value
	Use fuzzyarcface_resnet101_customized4 tau 0.1 100 epochs.pth for the best face verification precision
c. Compare obfuscated images for face verification of the same class
d. Does this for the entire CFP and JEFF dataset
